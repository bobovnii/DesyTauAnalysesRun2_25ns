Some additional scripts to put in STau directory to produce TABLES for making 2D plots
Some additional folders (outputTEST and combinedTEST) need to be created to not have overlap with previus results 
or you can rename folders in RunLimitsNew.sh

after running wrapper.sh TABLES will be produced, and can be used directly in ra4_stats

git clone https://github.com/ald77/ra4_stats
cd ra4_stats/
./compile.sh && ./run/limit_scan.exe -f txt/T1tttt_limit_scan.txt
